1. Take number of tests as input-T
2. Perform all validity checks on T(1<=T<=1000)
3. For a loop in range 0 to T, take a basic salary N to find the gross salary G
4. Perform all validity checks on N(1<=N<=100000)
5. if N is smaller than 1500, then HRA is 10% of N and DA is 90% of N
6. Otherwise, HRA is 500 and DA is 98% of N
7. Perform addition of N, HRA and DA and store the result in a variable G
