1. Take number of tests as input-T
2. Perform all validity checks on T(1<=T<=10)
3. For a loop in range 0 to T, take integer N and N-length array L to find maximum sum of costs of operations required to convert array into a single element 
4. Perform all validity checks on N(2<=N<=50000) and L(1<=L<=105)
5. Perform multiplication of minimum value in L (min(L)) and the size of L when only min(L) is present the L (n-1) which gives the minimum sum of costs of 
operations required to convert array into a single element
